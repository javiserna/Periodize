# A perfect python repository for estimating the rotation period of light curves files



### This repository contains three modes:

>- Estimate the period of the 

>- script to estimate the period and uncertainty of the light curve.

>- 


### Input requirement

>- A CSV file with three columns called ("time", "magnitude or flux", "magnitude_err or flux_err").

Periodize is thought to be used with the light curves files from the TESSExtractor application. Just search for the target of interest in the app and download the input file to Periodize.


#### How to use?
Locate at the repository folder and execute in terminal:

```zsh
$ python periodize.py "input_file.csv"



Feel free to use this app in any scientific project!
